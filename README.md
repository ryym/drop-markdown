# Drop Markdown

## About

Instant Markdown viewer on the WEB.
This is just a viewer, not an editor.

## Purpose

Sometimes, there is a need for me to display Markdown files
in the local machine without any tools or browser add-ons.

## TODO

* Multiple file viewing
* Styling
* Syntax highlight of code blocks
* Open links in a new tab
* Dealing with local links (how?)
